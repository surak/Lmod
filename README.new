Lmod 8.7+
   (8.7.1)  * Updates on 5/3 presentation.
   (8.7.2)  * Print message when unloading an unknown module (but not in a purge or dependent module)
   (8.7.3)  * Report warning when an MODULEPATH directory has too many non-modulefiles
            * A .version or .modulerc that has non-zero file length and doesn't start
              with "#%Module" is ignored.
	    * Report an Infinite loop error if loading the same modulefile 500 times.
	    * Add note to 095_tcl2lua.tcl about the whole TCL modulefile being evaluated by TCL.
	      Note also that this is not a SOURCE-to-SOURCE translation from TCL to Lua.
	    * Cannot use local with KSH
	    * Only add to mpathMapT when mpath_old ~= mpath_new in l_processNewModulePath(path).
   (8.7.4)  * Issue #578: Dynamic Spider Cache supported. 
            * Change Regular files counter to ignore files that start with "." when counting non-modulefiles in
              src/DirTree.lua
   (8.7.5)  * Issue #583: Using userName instead of sn when refreshing.
            * Issue #580: Add check for valid env. names for family(), setenv() etc.
            * Issue #580: Add check for valid alias and shell function names.
   (8.7.6)  * Change the way GIT_VERSION is found when installing Lmod
	    * Issue #584: Modify tcl2lua.tcl to reset the changes made to the environment when using
	      setenv and pushenv.
	    * Issue #587: Fix bug created with #580 namely that env vars can start with "_"
	    * Recalculate LMOD_SHELL_PGRM in bash.in to make sure that the Lmod shell matches the current
	      shell
   (8.7.7)  * Add option --miniConfig to report configuration differences from default.
            * Setting LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES to __NO_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES__ will allow
	      module reset to purge and reset $MODULEPATH to the system one.
	    * Make LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES a cosmic variable.
   (8.7.8)  * Add mcp:mustLoad() in cmdfuncs.lua: Unload(...).  Must catch case where
              reloading a replacement module depend on a module which is not there
              (See comments in test rt/depends_on/depends_on.tdesc about oneapi and impi)
            * Issue #593: In DirTree.lua l_versionFile(), Now only evaluate the highest priority
              entry in defaultA, instead of all.  This avoids the issue where there is a .modulerc.lua
              which works and a .modulerc or .version file which has syntax errors.
   (8.7.9)  * Correctly generate Version.lua file when installing from a tar ball.
   (8.7.10) * Issue #585: Add support for --with-mode=MODE
   (8.7.11) * Fix bug found in 8.7.10 about --with-mode=MODE
   (8.7.12) * Switch mode=user_default conversion to build time not configure time.
            * Taking Kenneth's suggestion to add where configuration variables are set.
              This is shown with --miniConfig or --config.
            * Unsetting FPATH inside configure.ac to avoid bad interaction with possible
              K-shell support.
            * ml now understands "--" to mean stop processing options.
            * LMOD_FAST_TCL_INTERP is set to true by default.  Make fixes to rt/commmon_funcs.sh to turn
              it off for tests.  Except that the end2end test needs it true.
            * Move cache file location from ~/.lmod.d/.cache/* to ~/.cache/lmod/*
            * Set FPATH in bash.in so that it works correctly with both Zsh and Ksh.
            * Issue #594: change cp -p to cp and mv to mv -f in update_lmod_system_spider_cache.in.
            * Now use UID_MIN from /etc/logins.def otherwise default to UID_MIN to 500 in proj_mgmt/convert_mode.sh
