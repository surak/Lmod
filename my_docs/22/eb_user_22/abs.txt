Title: Lmod and XALT: Updates

-----
Lmod
-----

Lmod is the modern Environment Module Tool.  Sysadmins define packages
and let users choice which package and which version of that package.
This part of the talk will include a brief overview of  Lmod.  This
will be followed up with the new features such as module overview,
updates to sh_to_modulefile and sourcing shell scripts inside
modulefiles with source_sh() plus other recent changes to Lmod.

----
XALT
----

XALT is a tool to take the census of what programs and libraries are
run on your cluster.  This talk will briefly cover what XALT does and
how it does it.  It will include some "war" stories of XALT
usage. Finally I'll cover recent changes to XALT. These include better
container support, a pre-ingestion filter, more compiler detection
(rust, chapel, etc) and better debugging support.
