Notes for 2/8 Talk about Passing current module data to isVisibleHook
routine.

* How to pass current module data to a hook
This can be done by the hooks themselves but I did it for you.

* Three Concepts
** There is a stack of the currently loaded modules => FrameStk in code
   It needs to be a stack because modules can load other modules
** This is true anytime a module is "loaded"
   this means it is true when evaluating modules in spyder operations.
** This stack contains "mname" objects
** Modules have three kinds of names: sn, usrName, fullName
** The Module Table contains the currently loaded modules and info about each one
** The module table is stored in the user env.
** The Module table is a Lua Table that contains key-value pairs
** The keys are the sn and the value is contents of the module info
** The MT contains the props stored with the module.

* So the soln was to:
** Ask for an instants of the frameStk Singleton
** Ask for the mname object from the top of the stack
** Ask for the mt    object from the top of the stack
** The user can get the sn from mname:sn()
** The user can get the properties from mt
   mt:haveProperty(sn, propName, propValue)
