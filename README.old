              a table'
            * Issue #439: Add force_update argument to Master:reloadAll() to 
              reload allmodules when doing a "module update"

            * Issue #448: Remove local keyword from findExec() so that ksh
	      won't barf.
   (8.3.10) * Improved support for ksh: Defined FPATH for bash, sh, csh (not zsh).
              the module, ml etc functions for ksh sub-shells
   (8.3.11) * Append FPATH for fish and prepend FPATH for csh, bash, tcsh/csh.
              Nothing for zsh as FPATH is a local variable.
	    * Only set FPATH when SSH_CLIENT is defined.  This protects zsh on

	    * Copy ksh functions to zsh site directory.
   (8.3.12) * Add configure option --with-supportKsh=no as default.  Configuring

   (8.3.13) * Move control of FPATH from profile.in/cshrc.in/profile.fish.in to
              bash.in/csh.in/fish.in. Sites rarely change profile/cshrc/profile.fish
	      so it is better for FPATH control to be in  bash.in/csh.in/fish.in.
	    * Allows the user to specify "Name/default" to load a module.  It is
	      exactly the same as "Name". Lmod just removes the string "/default"
	      from the userName in MName:new().

              (used in contrib/TACC/SitePackage.lua) 
   (8.2.3)  * Repaired the 8.2.1 version contrib/tracking_module_usage/createDB.py to now work.
   (8.2.4)  * Diagnostic messages should go to stderr.
            * issue #424: Make "ml - foo" and "module load - foo" report an error.
   (8.2.5)  * issue #426: Change depends_on() to use validateModules() instead of
              validateStringArgs() to validate the arguments from the user

   (8.2.7)  * issue #428: Changed extensions() function to take comma separated strings
            * issue #429: Corrected rt/between/err.txt file
	    * issue #430: Change extensions msgs to be multi-line
   (8.2.8)  * issue #428: Make extension() function only work with ',' only, not both comma or colon.
   (8.2.9)  * issue #426: Make between() accept a modulefile in the range but not the "best" one.
   (8.2.10) * Add support for "atleast()" and "between()" functions support a "<" to signify a 
              less than instead of less than or equal to between range.
   (8.2.11) * It is now safe to have os.exit(1) in a modulefile. Spider can now handle it.

              level 1 output.
   (8.1.3)  * Issue #402: Add a shell-dependent Shell:report_failure() instead of always emitting "false".

   (8.1.9)  * Issue #401: Create and use LMOD_ROOT to be the parent lmod directory is located.
   (8.1.10) * Add colorize() and color_banner() to sandbox for better message to users.
   (8.1.11) * Allow init/env_modules_python.py.in to take a string or an array. 
            * Change the way that Lmod determines the command.  Misspellings now fail.
	    * Add finalize hook to match startup hook.
	    * improved help message for disable.
   (8.1.12) * Issue #417: move the abspath test from building spiderT and dbT to just
              building reverseMapT

              not to include libtcl.so to point to the current tcl implementation.
            * issue #401: change tcl2lua.c to copy output string into an internal buffer. This avoids problems 
              found with some tcl interpreter (8.5.13 and earlier.
            * Issue with tcl2lua.tcl not handling modulefiles writing to stderr.  All output from the tcl modulefiles

   (8.0.2)  * All hidden files are NOT written to the softwarePage output.
            * Now automatically update docs/source/conf.py to the current version
            * Created proj_mgmt directory to store programs that needed to manage the project but are not installed.

   (7.7.22) luaposix 34.0.4-1 wants to use setfenv() which only exists in Lua 5.1 and not in Lua 5.2+
            so Lmod now requires("posix") outside of strict.
            Build lua-term in the correct location when --with-siteControlPrefix=yes
   (7.7.23) issue #347: Remove ./?.lua, ./?/init.lua from LUA_PATH and ./?.so from LUA_CPATH

   (7.7.36) Do not convert LMOD_PKG from /opt/apps/lmod/7.7.35 to /opt/apps/lmod/lmod if the link exists.
   (7.7.37) When building reverseMap also take abspath(path) and store it if different.
            Now make startup scripts (profile.in, cshrc.in, profile.fish.in) use PKGV instead of PKG so
	    that the pre-install create $VERSION files. The install target will convert them to PKG.
   (7.7.38) Check for "g" tools like gbasename, gexpr as well as the regular basename, expr etc.
            General support for the modulerc files to be written in lua. They have a .lua extension.
   (7.7.39) Bug fix for 7.7.38 where it did not work for Lua 5.1

### Lmod 6.6:

Features:

  1. Now uses the value of LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH found at configure time to run all TCL progams.

  2. Now uses a custom _module_dir function for tab completion in bash for module use path<TAB>. Thanks to Pieter Neerincx!

  3. Support for LMOD_FAMILY_<name>_VERSION added.

  4. If ~/.lmod.d/.cache/invalidated exists then the user cache file(s) are ignored. When generating a user cache file ~/.lmod.d/.cache/invalidated is deleted.

Bug Fixes:

  1. Correctly merges spider cache location where there are multiple lmodrc.lua files.

  2. Remove leading and trailing blanks for names in setenv, pushenv, prepend_path, etc.

  3. ml now generates error for unknown argument that start with a double minus. (e.g. ml --vers)

  4. pushenv("name","") fixed when unloading module.

  5. Make sure to regularize MODULEPATH when ingesting it for the first time.

### Lmod 6.5:

Features:

  1. All the Lmod programs now resolve any symlinks to the actual program before adding to the Lua's package.path and package.cpath.

  2. Contrib patch: Extend msgHook to LmodError and LmodWarning.

  3. Now using travis for CI and testing.

  4. Configure time option to have Lmod check for magic TCL string in modulefiles (#%Module)

Bug Fixes:

  1. The command "savelist" now only reports collections that match $LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME (install of all collections).

  2. A collection name now CANNOT have `.' in its name.

  3. Contrib patch: Get correct status in a capture in Lua 5.1.

  4. Contrib patch: Failback to /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid if uuidgen isn't available.

  5. Contrib patch: Failback to shasum if sha1sum isn't available.

  6. Now uses the tclsh (and the LD_LIBRARY_PATH) found at configure time.

  7. Now searches for ps, basename, expr in /bin and /usr/bin when not using the locations found by configure

### Lmod 6.4:

Features:

   1. Lmod now uses a regular expression to match user commands to internal commands. For example "av", "ava" or "available" will match "avail".

Bug Fixes:

   1. Lmod now obeys LMOD_REDIRECT (or module --redirect) when using the --terse option.  This means that if LMOD_REDIRECT is set then module -t av will go to stdout instead of stderr.

   2. Lmod now does not resolve any symlinks when doing "module use <path>"

   3. LMOD_REDIRECT is now reported with --config option.

   4. Lmod would sometimes miss a symlink to a directory with module use.  This is now fixed.

   5. Lmod now correctly ignores a valid .version/.modulerc file that points to a non-existent modulefile.

   6. Allow the use of md5 -r as an alternative to sha1sum and md5sum

   7. Added uninstall target to Lmod.


### Lmod 6.3:

Bug Fixes:

   1. Lmod now uses the values of LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH at configuration time.  This way Lmod is safe from user changes to these important Lua values.

### Lmod 6.2:

Bug Fixes:

   1. Updated documentation at lmod.readthedocs.org

   2. Support for generating xalt_rmapT.json used by XALT.

   3. Fixed bug with upcase characters in version file.

### Lmod 6.1:

Features:

   1. It is now possible to configure Lmod to use the spider cache when loading (`--with-cachedLoads=yes` or `export LMOD_CACHED_LOADS=1` to activate). This is off by default. Sites that use this will have to keep their spider caches up-to-date or user will not be able to load modules not in the cache.

   2. It is now possible to configure Lmod to use Legacy Version ordering (`--with-legacyOrdering=yes` or `export LMOD_LEGACY_VERSION_ORDERING=1`). With legacy ordering 9.0 is "newer" than 10.0. This is the ordering that Tmod uses.

   3. Lmod will print admin message (a.k.a nag messages) when doing module whatis <foo> or module help <foo>.  In other words if a nag message would appear with module load <foo> then it will also appear when using whatis or help.

   4. Many improvement in the generation of the lmod database for module tracking.

   5. Added function userInGroup() to limit access to loading a module.

Bug Fixes:

   1. The command module spider would fail to find a module if a site had the spider cache file dbT.lua files and a user had personal modulefiles. This is now fixed.

   2. Two or more .version files could confused Lmod.  This is now fixed.

   3. Lmod can now find UPPER CASE string when doing "module key ..."

   4. Lmod now ignore the value of PAGER, instead it uses LMOD_PAGER (default "less") and LMOD_PAGER_OPTS (default "-XqRMEF").  This allows for consistent behavior under systems like the Cray and Mac OS X.

   5. Lmod now reports the module stack when loads fail.

   6. Set $LMOD_REVERSEMAPT_DIR after $LMOD_CACHE_DIR in update_lmod_system_cache_files.

   7. Support for exit 1 in tcl modulefiles.

   8. Fixed bug in tcl and unsetenv.

### Lmod 6.0.1:

Bug Fixes:

   1. This version now contains the contrib/tracking_module_usage directory.

   2. This version fixes a bug when trying to run module avail or module spider with an old cache file.


### Lmod Version 6.0

Features:

   1. Full support for global RC files as well as .modulerc files. This means that $MODULERCFILE will be read along with ~/.modulerc. Also .modulerc files are read when they appear in the same directory and the version files (i.e. the same directory as 1.2 or 2.1.lua). One caveat, Setting the default module version in $MODULERCFILE or ~/.modulerc is not supported due Spider cache issues.

   2. Instructions on how to save module usage data to a MySQL database along with scripts to analyze the usage are in contrib/tracking_module_usage/README.

   3. Adding an exit hook.  This makes for more accurate tracking of module usage. See README above as to why this is a good idea.

   4. Some minor speed-ups and minimizing of directory tree

Lmod Version 5.9.3
Features:
   a) Lmod has been ported to Lua 5.3.
   b) Thanks to Kenneth Hoste, a parameterized script, called
      update_lmod_system_cache_files, to build system spider caches
      has been added as part of Lmod. There is no need to modify
      createSystemCacheFile.sh (in contrib/BuildSystemCacheFile)
      to suit your site.
   c) Sites and users now have a choice about restores from a
      saved collection. Normally Lmod will follow defaults when
      restoring.  That is if you saved a collection with a default
      module, Lmod will load the default upon restore, even if the
      default module has changed.  By configuring Lmod, you can
      keep the same versions.  Users can control this by setting
      LMOD_PIN_VERSIONS to true, or --pin_versions.

Lmod Version 5.9.1
Bug fixes
   a) The spider cache is now ignored on unloads, show as well as
      loads.
   b) Lmod treats symlink directories and files much more quickly.
      It also means that Lmod DOES NOT resolve two symlink
      directories pointing to the same place.  It is too expensive
      to resolve that on parallel file systems.
   c) Initialization with Csh now works even when $TERM is not
      set.
Features:
   a) Bash and Zsh tab-completion now support module restore <tab>
      with the savelist.
   b) The standard setup sets LMOD_VERSION as part of the startup
      procedure.

Lmod Version 5.9
Feature:
   a) Several changes to support faster avail with the spider cache.
      This change requires updating the way the system spider cache
      is built.  See contrib/BuildSystemCacheFile/README.txt.  On an
      ssd laptop "ml av" is twice as fast.  On two different HPC system
      I have seen 4 times speed improvement.

Bug Fixes:
   a) Fixed a bug where LUA_INCLUDE was not set.

Lmod Version 5.8.6
Bug Fixes:
   a) Fixed a bug several modulefiles where marked as default
   b) Two different fixes which will improve the speed of
      reading the the cache file.
   c) Configure will now abort if either tclsh or lua.h is
      required but not available.

Lmod Version 5.8.5
Features/Bug fixes:
   a) Fixed bug where the system spider cache was ignored.  This bug
      was introduced in 5.8.  It is fixed now.
   b) Support for disabling same name autoswapping added.  This is
      not active by default.
   c) Removed extra newlines when doing module list.
   d) Correctly handle symlink directories with MODULEPATH.
   e) Improved Spider support where module names have "-"
   f) Fixed problem where lmodrc.lua was left out in tar ball.
   g) Fixed problem where src/ignore_dirs_converter was left out
      in tar ball.

Lmod Version 5.8
Features/Bug fixes:
   a) Lmod support auto swapping instead of producing an error.
   b) The init/bash.in and init/cshrc add a trailing colon to
      MANPATH if it is empty
   c) Fixes bug in ml tab completion for zsh.
   d) setenv, prepend_path, etc now trim any leading or trailing
      blanks around name: prepend_path(" MANPATH ","/opt/apps/...")
      is now the same as prepend_path("MANPATH","/opt/apps/...")
   e) The module command (and not ml) support combining of single
      letter options.  "module -dw=60 avail" is the same as
      "module -d -w=60 avail".
   f) If a module collection file gets corrupted, Lmod now reports
      that the collection file is corrupted and tells the user to
      remove it.
   g) Lmod now support "module swap <name>" which is exactly the
      same as "module load <name>".  The module <name> is unloaded
      and then reloaded.
   h) Sites can configure for exporting the module shell function
      in bash or not.


Lmod Version 5.7.5:
Features/Bug fixes:
   a) "module use" and "ml use" now will work with tab completion
      under bash. (It worked before for zsh).
   b) New option, --spider_timeout sec is added.  Reason: When
      Lmod can not load a module, it does a module spider to
      see if the module exists but isn't loadable.  Now Lmod
      doesn't do the spider when in LMOD_EXPERT mode.  It also
      times out after 2 seconds.  If Lmod can't tell you quickly
      if a module exists, why do it.
   c) New configuration option --with-ignoreDirs.  By default
      Lmod will ignore directories named .svn, .git, .hg and .bzr
      in the Module directories. If you use CVS, RCS or SCCS to
      source control your modulefiles, you will need configure
      Lmod to know about those directories.
   d) New avail hook added.  You can regroup the output of avail.
      The avail hook gets a table of current directories that avail
      will list.  Your routine can relabel them.  The input looks
      like this:

         t = {
	    ['/path/to/IntelCmp/mfiles'] = "/path/to/IntelCmp/mfiles"
	    ['/path/to/core/mfiles']     = "/path/to/core/mfiles"
	 }
	
      Your routine can relabel and change the labels

         t = {
	    ['/path/to/IntelCmp/mfiles'] = "Compiler Dependent"
	    ['/path/to/core/mfiles']     = "Core Modules"
	 }
      You can also group them
         t = {
	    ['/path/to/IntelCmp/mfiles'] = "Modules"
	    ['/path/to/core/mfiles']     = "Modules"
	 }
      In the last case intel modules and core modules will be
      grouped together.
   e) Better handling of zsh tab completion files.  Lmod will
      continue to install even when a site's zsh setup is
      broken.
   f) New option, --show_hidden, has been added. This is used
      with avail to show "hidden" modulefiles.  That is module
      files that start with a "."

Lmod Version 5.7.4
Features/Bug fixes:
   a) Improved support for redirecting output to stdout.  Now show,
      and help will write to stdout if LMOD_REDIRECT=yes.
   b) module show unknown will set the return error code if "unknown"
      doesn't exist.
   c) "module --terse spider phdf5" will now produce a terse output.
   d) a module file can do setenv("FOO","") and set the env.var to an
      empty string.
   e) Support for empty strings "" in paths are better supported.

Lmod Version 5.7.2
Features:
   a) This version supports (an optional) sending the output of avail, list,
      spider and keyword stdout instead of stderr.  This available as a
      configure option, an environment variable (LMOD_REDIRECT=yes) or
      module --redirect avail.

      Note that if you use this option the internal pager is off.


Lmod Version 5.7
Features:
   a) Lmod is now more efficient when loading and unloading
      modulefiles that modify MODULEPATH when there is no
      cache file.
   b) Lmod now reports that lua-term is active or not when
      "module --config". This is there so that if Lmod is
      built on a system that as a system lua-term on one and
      is installed on a different system that doesn't.
   c) module spider now reports module version in "parseVersion"
      order. (i.e 0.7.10 is newer than 0.7.2)
   d) Internally Lmod sets LC_ALL=C so that a user's Locale does
      not effect its behavior.

Bug Fixes:
   a) Lmod can now handle TCL modulefiles that use
      "puts --nonewline ..."
   b) TCL whatis with multiple arguments is now correctly handled.
   c) Changed require("posix")  to local posix=require("posix")
   d) TCL "puts" and "puts stdout" goes to stdout.  TCL "puts stderr"
      goes to stderr.

Lmod Version 5.6.3
Bug Fixes:
   a) Lmod now correctly handles prepending multiple directories to
      MODULEPATH in one prepend_path.

Lmod Version 5.6.2
Bug Fixes:
   a) LMOD_EXPERT is now also turns on quiet mode.  It was removed
      accidentally in 5.6.1 and is now restored.
   b) Lmod had a bug where it tracked prereq, conflict and family
      commands in module collections where it didn't need to.
      This means that some users will have to rebuild their module
      collections when they shouldn't have to.

Lmod Version 5.6.1
Features:
   a) The environment variable LMOD_OPTIONS can be use to specify
      command line options to LMOD:  export LMOD_OPTIONS="--quiet"
   b) The environment variable LMOD_PAGER can use to specify the pager
      that Lmod will use, otherwise PAGER is used or "more"
   c) the -q or --quiet option suppresses messages and warnings (but not
      errors).
Bug Fix:
   a) Executing "module list" when there no modules loaded is a message
      and not a warning.

Lmod Version 5.6
Major Bug Fix:
   Two bugs I have un-earthed cancelled each other all related to saved
   collections.  The upshot is that many users will have get a message
   that they have to rebuild their collection because the modules have
   changed.  This isn't true but they will have to anyway.  I now have
   tests which will guard against this from happening  again.  I
   apologize  for this bug.


Bug Fixes:
   a) Lmod is supposed to error out if the modules in a named
      collection changed in a way such that the loaded modules would be
      different from loading directly.  This is fixed.
   b) This version correctly handles prepending to the MODULEPATH outside
      of Lmod
   c) Lmod now correctly handles symlinks to a template in the same
      directory.  Lmod also support the three ways to mark a default
      with this setup as well.
   d) Lmod now correctly handles "module-info mode" command in tcl
      modulefiles.
   e) tcl2lua.sh improvements to supports Cray modules.

Feature:
   a) Support for .modulerc in modulefile directory only.  This file can
      be used to specify the default module only.  No support for System
      .modulerc or user ~/.modulerc

Lmod Version 5.5.1:
Bug Fixes:
   a) Fixed bug where setting the priority twice caused an error. This is now
      fixed.
   b) A meta module that starts with "." will not seen by avail and spider.

Lmod Version 5.5:
Feature:
   a) priorities can now be used with "module use":
      $ module use --priority 100 /path/to/modulefiles


Bug Fixes:
   a) Configuring on a system where tclsh is not found is handled better.
   b) When doing module avail where MODULEPATH points only to non-existent
      path it now reports that Lmod can not do a module avail.


Lmod Version 5.4.2:
Feature:
   a) Sites with common home file system can use named collections that are
      differentiated by LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME.   This means that if the environment
      variable LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME is set to "foo" then the default collection will
      be saved to and restored from "default.foo".  Other named collections work
      the same way.

Bug Fix:
   a) TCL modules can now have:
        puts "message"
      as well.


Lmod Version 5.4.1:
   Added License file to tar ball.

Lmod Version 5.4:
Features:
   a) prepend_path now supports a priority.  This means that no matter when
      a module is loaded a path will pushed to be first:

      	 prepend_path{"PATH","/first",priority=100}  -- lua
      	 prepend-path  PATH   /first           100   #  tcl


      Note the use of {} braces for lua. The braces are only required when
      specifying the priority, otherwise parens work fine.  Priority works
      for append_path as well.  It just pushes paths to the right end.  By
      default, a path has a priority of zero.  Paths will a priority of 100
      are grouped together. Paths with a priority of 1000 are grouped
      together to the left of the paths with a priority of 100.  The priority
      for prepend_path are useful for wrappers.  The priority for append_path
      is great for catch-alls.
   b) Lmod now generates "LOADEDMODULES" and "_LMFILES_" to match TCL/C env.
      modules.
   c) Lmod now purges modules in reverse order that the module were loaded.
      This helps when reading Cray modulefiles.
   d) Lmod ships with lua-term and JSON4lua but will use the system lua-term
      and lua-json if available.
   e) added "--raw" to "module --raw show module".  This just prints out the
      "raw" modulefile.
   f) Lmod now adds the env. var LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME to the user cache file. So
      if LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME is Bar and on a intel system the cache file will be
      ~/.lmod.d/.cache/moduleT.Bar_x86_64.lua
   g) To match TCL/C modules, the reverse of the module file commands
      remove_path, unload, etc now does nothing rather-than producing an
      error.
   h) Support for a .version file with time to change the default:

           #%Module1.0##################################################
           set ModulesVersion        "1.4.3"
           set NewModulesVersion     "1.6.5"
           set NewModulesVersionDate "2014/04/25"

      Note that the date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. This way it is neither an
      American or European format.
   i) To support both rpm and debian package rules, the system .settarg.lua
      file is renamed to settarg_rc.lua.  The .lmodrc.lua file has been
      renamed to lmodrc.lua.   User versions of these files remains the same:
      ".settarg.lua" and ".lmodrc.lua".

Bug Fixes:
   a) There was a bug with avail and spider where it would not find modules
      with a dash.  This was fixed between version 5.2.3 and now.
   b) There was a bug with "module -r spider "^phdf5/1.8.12$" where it would
      say that the module wasn't there and yet it was.  This has been fixed.
   c) Improved the wording of "module load foo/1.2" when foo/1.2 existed and
      when it didn't.  (Thanks to Alex Moskalenko for the fix)
   d) Lmod would do wrong when "module unload gcc mpich".  It would make
      mpich inactive.  This is fixed.
   e) Fixed bug where if there is a symbolic link to the modulefile it wouldn't
      mark the default module correctly.

Lmod Version 5.3.2:
Bug Fix:
   a) Fixed problem with symlink directories and picking the right default.
   b) Fixed a bug where .version did not find the right default.

Lmod Version 5.3.1:
Feature:
   a) added tool "sh_to_modulefile" to convert a bash shell script into
      a lua based shell script.:

   $ sh_to_modulefile -o intel-14.0.2.lua  /a/intel/bin/iccvars.sh intel64

   note that you can give argument to the shell script.


Lmod Version 5.3:
Features:
   a) Searching for avail, spider and list are case-insensitive.
      Lua regexp searching now requires a "-r" option
   b) The modulefile function isloaded() takes atleast, between and latest:
        isloaded(atleast("Foo","1.2"))
   c) Spider searching improved.  When an exact match is found Lmod reports
      other possible matches:

     R: R/2.1.5
       Other possible modules matches:
          PrgEnv, greenlet, parmetis, r


Bug Fix:
   a) Quotes inside a whatis or help message are properly escaped.
   b) Better handling of nested modules by fixing load order.

Lmod Version 5.2.4:
Feature:
  a) Lmod can be configured to ignore TCL module files.

Lmod Version 5.2.3:
Bug Fixes:
  a) Prereq now works with a version.
  b) The function "always_load" works with show.
  c) The "make install" now works and doesn't complain about not being a
     git repository.

Lmod Version 5.2:
Features:
  a) Modulefiles can mix load commands and setenv's and still be saved and restored.
  b) In Lua modulefiles you can modify load function behavior:
        load(atleast("a","1.2"))       -- load module "a" with version 1.2
                                       -- or higher.
        load(between("b","1.2","1.4")  -- load module "b" with version between
                                       -- 1.2 and 1.4.
        load(latest("c"))              -- load latest version of "c", ignore
                                       -- marked default.

     This only works in Lua module files, and works on all load functions:
     load, always_load.
  c) In Lua modulefiles you can modify prereq function behavior:
        prereq(atleast("a","1.2"))      -- Module "a" must be version 1.2
                                        -- or higher.
        prereq(between("b","1.2","1.4") -- Module "b" must be version between
                                        -- 1.2 and 1.4.
        prereq(latest("c"))             -- Module "c" must be latest possible

     This only works in Lua module files, and works on all prereq functions:
     prereq, prereq_any.


Lmod Version 5.1.5:
Bug Fixes:
  a) Changes in the terse output for avail and spider.  A directory
     that contains module versions has a trailing "/"
  b) The environment that a module sees (and only in that environment).
     Lmod defines the following variables shown with their current values:
        LMOD_VERSION:          5.1.5
        LMOD_VERSION_MAJOR:    5
        LMOD_VERSION_MINOR:    1
        LMOD_VERSION_SUBMINOR: 5

  c) Module function to do version comparison (only for lua based modulefiles):

       if (convertToCanonical(LmodVersion()) > convertToCanonical("5.0")) then
          -- Do something that is only valid for Lmod 5.0 or greater
       end

    The function convertToCanonical() knows how to deal with alpha, beta,
    and rc version and the function LmodVersion() returns the current
    version of Lmod.


Lmod Version 5.1.1:
Bug Fixes and internal improvements
  a) Lmod can now find all the dot module files.
  b) Fixed bug with inherit()
  c) Settarg nolonger tries to control all TARG_* variables.
  d) Better handling of "Rebuild cache ..." line.
  e) Improvements to the execute function.
  f) "module --mt" prints the module table
  g) "settarg --stt" prints the settarg table.

Lmod Version 5.1.0:

Version 5.1.0 now supports the following new features:

a) module --ignore_cache which tells Lmod to ignore the cache even if it
   exists.

b) module --config reports how lmod was configured.
 
c) Lmod no longer walks the directory tree on command like list and
   unload.

d) The pager is now used only when TERM is defined and stderr is
   connected to a tty (this includes a pty: pseudo tty).

e) The system startup scripts (init/profile, and init/cshrc) that
   are usually linked to modules.sh and modules.csh in /etc/profile.d
   contains now modulefiles: lmod and settarg.  Please consider using
   this as defined or moving these module files into your normal
   MODULEPATH.

f) Support for settarg has been added for Bash, Zsh and Tcsh users.

g) See README.old for features added in earlier versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Settarg?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Settarg is new module that accesses a new tool to dynamically and
automatically updates "$TARG" and a host of other environment
variables. These new environment variables encapsulate the state of
the modules loaded.

                        *** NOTE ****

Please note that settarg feature is optional and is implemented as a
module.  If and only if the settarg module is loaded you get the new
behavior.  You can load and unload the settarg module at will to turn
on and off these new features.  Settarg does work for tcsh users as
well a feat not to be scoffed at! Unfortunately regular csh is
missing necessary features for it to work.

                        *** NOTE ****


For example, if I have the gcc/4.7.2 module loaded
and the new settarg module loaded I get the following variables
defined in my environment.


   TARG=OBJ/_x86_64_06_1a_gcc-4.7.3
   TARG_COMPILER=gcc-4.7.3
   TARG_COMPILER_FAMILY=gcc
   TARG_MACH=x86_64_06_1a

If I change my compiler to intel/13.1.0, these variables change to:

   TARG=OBJ/_x86_64_06_1a_intel-13.1.0
   TARG_COMPILER=intel-13.1.0
   TARG_COMPILER_FAMILY=intel
   TARG_MACH=x86_64_06_1a

This was designed to help me as a developer of software applications
where I am constantly changing compilers, mpi stacks and other
modules. These variable are used to set the compiler flags and other
things in my Makefiles to control how my application is built. In my
case $TARG the directory is where the the objects, libraries and
executables are placed during the build process. It easy to have the
title bar reflect the dynamic state of your modules. You can
abbreviate items mentioned in the titlebar.  I have found this
combination of settarg and Lmod to be a powerful development
tool. Even if this workflow is not yours, you may find parts of this
useful.

For a more complete tour of settargs features see:
contrib/settarg/Settarg.txt and the Make example in
contrib/settarg/make_example.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release of Lmod marks yet another internal refactoring of how it
works. The commands that your users see remains the same but the
internal on how it works has.   It is VERY VERY MUCH recommended that
you read the INSTALL file before trying to install this new version of
Lmod.  For the impatient, the major changes are:

   * This and future version of Lmod rely on the spider cache.  This
     speeds thing up and spider should now never crash w.r.t bad module
     files.
   * All module files are loaded through a "sandbox" which means that
     a module file can only call functions that are known to the sandbox.
     Those of you using the SitePackage.lua or similar will need to
     register your functions with the sandbox
   * Bad module files which can be: (1) bad syntax, (2) invalid
     arguments, (3) Calling functions that modulefiles shouldn't.  All
     of these mistakes should be caught and not kill building of the
     spider cache file.
   * A new hook function will make it easier for module use tracking
     without having to have special functions inside of your module
     files.
   * Support for multilevel modulefile naming schemes.  Lmod now
     supports naming scheme such as  category/name/version. (C/N/V)
     It will actually supports category/sub_category/name/version or
     any depth that your users will tolerate that much typing.

Version 5.0.1
  Bug Fix:
    1) This version handles old cache files instead of crashing.
    2) Correctly handling of Personal module directories.
    3) Correctly handles isloaded function for TCL modulefiles.
    4) Tracks MODULEPATH changes external to Lmod.
  Feature:
    1) Bash/Zsh command line tab completion for both module and ml
       commands.  The Zsh support is added to the site-function directory
       under Zsh control.
    2) Support for multiple system cache files added, see
       contrib/BuildSystemCacheFile/README.txt for more details.
    3) New option "--terse" for list, avail and spider.  This
       produces machine readable output.
    4) New option "--default" for avail.  This will list only the
       default modules.
    5) Hook function added.
    6) C/N/V supported
    7) Sandbox for modulefiles.
    8) Strong use of Spider cache file.
    9) Support for new function pushenv("name","value"). It works
       like setenv("name","value"), but when the module is unloaded
       the old value is returned.  Suppose you have both a gcc module
       and an mpich module that both set CC by either setenv or pushenv.
       Then:

          #                                      SETENV         PUSHENV
          $ module load   gcc;    echo $CC  # -> CC=gcc         CC=gcc
          $ module load   mpich;  echo $CC  # -> CC=mpicc       CC=mpicc
          $ module unload mpich;  echo $CC  # -> CC is unset    CC=gcc
          $ module unload gcc;    echo $CC  # -> CC is unset    CC is unset

       If you use both setenv("CC","..." ) then when unloading mpich
       CC has no value.  If you use pushenv("CC","...") then CC will
       return to "gcc" after unloading mpich and have no value when
       gcc is unloaded.  What is pushed can be complicated and have
       colons in the text.  One could push PS1 for different prompts.
   10) New option "--latest" for load and swap.  This option loads
       or swaps out the latest version and ignores the default version.


Version 4.2.1:
  Features:
    1) Spider cache file changes: If a site has a system cache file
       then a user with personal module directories will use the
       system cache and only store their personal cache.
    2) This version makes multiple prepending multiple work in
       "normal" and not "reverse" order.  Previous version had
       this "reverse" be the default.
    3) There is now a "pre-install" target which does everything
       but make the link between the new version and "lmod"
  Bug Fixes:
    1) If the system changes the default module directories and
       a user has a named collection then Lmod will report that
       the system MODULEPATH has changed and it will load system
       defaults and not the users collection.

Version 4.1.4:
 Bug Fixes:
   1) When the warning is produced the Lmod Warning message is
      now colorized (just the Lmod Warning part)
   2) There is now a small change in "module restore". Previously
      if a save module changed or did not exist the whole restore
      would error.  Now Lmod reports which modules are missing and
      which modules have changed, it then loads all requested
      modules that it can find.


Version 4.1:
 Features:
   1) Save/Restore replaced getdefault/setdefault.  See module help
      for more details.
   2) Default module chosen by version sorting.  So foo/5.10 will
      be the default even though foo/5.6 exists. See
      src/parseVersion.lua comments for complete rules.  There is
      a test code in contrib/parseVersions/pv. Below is a list
      of how version will be sorted. The left side shows a
      package version, the right side shows the internal string
      generated to sort version numbers.

   2.4dev1: 000000002.000000004.*@.000000001.*zfinal
     2.4a1: 000000002.000000004.*a.000000001.*zfinal
  2.4beta2: 000000002.000000004.*beta.000000002.*zfinal
    2.4rc1: 000000002.000000004.*c.000000001.*zfinal
       2.4: 000000002.000000004.*zfinal
   2.4.0.0: 000000002.000000004.*zfinal
     2.4-1: 000000002.000000004.*zfinal-.000000001.*zfinal
 2.4.0.0.1: 000000002.000000004.000000000.000000000.000000001.*zfinal
     2.4.1: 000000002.000000004.000000001.*zfinal

       3.2: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal
     3.2-0: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal
    3.2-p0: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal
     3.2p0: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal
     3.2-2: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal-.000000002.*zfinal
    3.2-p3: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal-.000000003.*zfinal


 Bug Fix:
   1) Better handling of swapping out modules: default modules
      find default modules when swapped.  Non-default modules do
      not.


Version 4.0.1/4.0.2/4.0.3:
 Bug Fixes:
   1) Better savings of module cache file on fast systems.
   2) Fixed bug with csh use of "set_shell_function()"
   3) Fixed build error on Redhat based systems.
   4) Fixed SitePackage: only do things on mode() == 'load'
   5) Fixed SitePackage to be read by all Lmod tools.
   6) Lmod correctly handles a ^C when using more as PAGER.

Version 4.0:
 New Requirement:
  You will need the lua header files.  This will typically
  require the lua-devel or liblua5.1-0-dev or similar packages.

 Features:
  1) A handy front end for the module command: ml
        $ ml
                                 means: module list
        $ ml foo bar
                                 means: module load foo bar
        $ ml -foo -bar baz goo
                                 means: module unload foo bar;
                                        module load baz goo;

     It does much more, do: "ml --help" for more information.

  2) Now uses the env. var PAGER or /bin/more to page through
     "module spider" and "module avail"

  3) Lmod now supports properties:

     add_property("arch","value1")
     add_property("arch","value2")

     See lmodrc.lua for how to setup your properties.

  4) Lmod now knows if stderr is connected to a terminal or not.
     This means that the pager (and the color output of properties)
     are bypassed and straight text is written out when the output
     is a file and not a tty.  (Thanks to pieces from lua-term:
     git://github.com/hoelzro/lua-term.git)


  5) Support for shell functions under bash or csh aliases.
     For lua module files only:

        set_shell_function("name","bash_function_str",
                                  "csh_alias_str")

     so the new ml command can be defined in a lua module file as:

        set_shell_function("ml",'eval $($LMOD_DIR/ml_cmd "$@")',
                                "eval `$LMOD_DIR/ml_cmd $*`")

     (csh alias internally translate the "$*" to "\!*")

     NOTE: Subshells do NOT inherit alias or shell functions!
     This means every subshell will need to load any modules that
     define aliases or shell functions.

  6) added module functions "always_load(...)", "always_unload(...)"
     The function "always_load('abc')" could be replaced by:

        if (mode() == "load") then
           load('abc')
        end

     That is, it always loads and never unloads.

     The always_unload('abc') inside a modulefile will ALWAYS
     cause the module 'abc' to be unloaded.  This is safe to do even
     if the module is not loaded.

  7) Support for a "SitePackage" lua file to add functions to be available
     for your lua based modulefiles.  See contrib/SitePackage for an example.



Version 3.6/3.6.1:

 Features:
    1) The command:
         $ module spider foo
       is now a case-insensitive search.  This means that "foo" will
       match "foo", "Foo", "FooBar" and "BarFoo".
    2) The "mode()" function return:

         load, unload, help, whatis, spider

       depending on what mode the module file is beening read.

    3) Note that when reading in modules with the "computeHash" program
       the mode is "load".  The computeHash program is used to compute
       sha1 hashes of files as part of the setdefault/getdefault commands.


 Bug Fixes:
    1) set_alias() now correctly load and unloads, doesn't load
       during spider.
    2) module spider doesn't stop on a modulefile syntax error.
       It reports the error and keeps going.
    3) Loading a modulefile with a syntax error is handled
       cleanly.
    4) Lmod now searches all possible caches and picks the one which is newest.

Version 3.5.1/3.5.2:

   Features:

   1) Support for perl added.
   2) Support for python added:

      Example:

      #!/usr/bin/env python

      import os, sys
      sys.path.insert(0,"/opt/apps/lmod/lmod/setup/")

      from env_modules_python import module

      module("load","foobar")

      print "os.environ['FOOBAR']: ",os.environ['FOOBAR']

      module("avail");



Version 3.4.2:

   Features:

   1) A Lua modulefile can have a new command "try_load()". It is
      the same as a load() EXCEPT that it will not produce an error
      if the module does NOT exist.

   2) Similarly a TCL modulefile can have:

        module try-add foo

      which will load "foo" if it exists.  If it doesn't then there is
      no error reported.

Version 3.4.1/3.4.0

  Changes/Features:

  1) The structure of modules file directories has been extended.
     Previous versions required that symbolic links could only be used
     with files and not directories.  You can now use a symlink to
     a directory.  This is useful when trying to use Lmod with an existing
     module tree.


  2) The module list can be search:

     $ module list pattern1 pattern2 ...

     This command will report any module loaded that match pattern1
     or pattern2 ...

     $ module list gcc b

     Currently Loaded Modules Matching: gcc or b
     1) gcc/4.6.2  2) boost/1.49.0

  3) The configure script now checks to see that both lfs and posix are
     available or the script quits.

  4) Support for a system cache directory:

     ./configure --with-spiderCacheDir=/path/to/systemCacheDir

     On slow file system such as lustre a "module spider" can take
     a while. If one creates a cron that runs hourly to produce a
     spider file.

     spider -o moduleT $LMOD_DEFAULT_MODULEPATH > /path/to/systemCacheDir/moduleT.lua


  Bug fixes:

  1) Previously modules name with special regular expression
     characters such as "-" would not be found with "module avail"
     and "module spider" now they will.

  2) There was a subtle bug with the way the module table was written
     out and read from the environment.  In rare cases, the module table
     could get corrupted.   This is now fixed.

  3) Previously, if MODULEPATH was not set then a lua error would be
     reported. This is now fixed.


Version 3.3.9

  1) This version fixes a bug in spider output.  Now if a modulefile
     could be found via two or more ways through the software hierarchy,
     all parents will be reported.
  2) A new module command "reset" is now supported.  If the environment
     variable "LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES" contains a list of modules
     then issuing "module reset" will do a "module purge" and then load
     the list of modules specified by the this env. variable.
  3) Users can now specify directories as part of the name given to a
     "module default" name.  In other words doing
     "module setdefault foo/bar/baz" will create a file
     $HOME/.lmod.d/foo/bar/baz that has the current list of modules.
     Doing "module getdefault foo/bar/baz" will revive it.
  4) A new function "is_spider()" has been added. It return true if the
     modulefile being read by the spider command.

Version 3.3.6

  This version supports a different separator for path like variables:
  For TCL module files, it supports the "--delim" style:

    prepend-path --delim ";" LUA_PATH  "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.lua;/apps/lua/share/5.1/?;;"
    append-path  --delim ";" LUA_CPATH "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.so"

  For lua modulefiles you can give an optional third argument:

    prepend_path("LUA_PATH",  "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.lua;/a/lua/share/5.1/?;;",";")
    append_path( "LUA_CPATH", "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.so", ";")

Version 3.3.5

  This version better handles reporting the same module at multiple levels
  of the hierarchy through "module spider". If a module is a "Core" module
  as well as compiler and/or mpi/compiler dependent,
  "module spider" now reports that.


Version 3.2.1

  This version set return an error if there are any warning.  So if a user
  does:

     $ module load foo bar baz

  and "foo" and "bar" exist and "baz" does not then Lmod will load "foo"
  and "bar" and report a warning that "baz" wasn't loaded.


Version 3.1.2

  This version of Lmod supports the module command: "module spider" which
  will tell users all the modules that are possible independent of where
  the files are in the module hierarchy.

Version 2.13

  This version of Lmod provide support for the "family" command.  The family
  command makes it easy to prevent user from loading two version of the same
  "family".  For example on our system, most users should not have two
  compilers loaded at the same time.  To support this feature, all you need
  do is add the following to all the compiler modulefiles:

  For TCL modulefiles do:

    family "compiler"

  For lua module files do:

    family("compiler")

  The word in quotes is case-sensitive so "Compiler" and "compiler" and
  "COMPILER" are all different.

  You can have different families.  So we currently have a "compiler"
  family and a "MPI" family.

  Expert users really want two of the same family loaded at the same time
  can set the environment variable "LMOD_EXPERT" to "1".  This will bypass
  the test for them.
